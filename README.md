# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## What I did

* I used the template of Udacity and changed in style.css
* I made a local server using node.JS and express framework
* I got the API from https://openweathermap.org/ and the body picture from https://pixabay.com/
* I used POST and GET to use the ZIP code to get temperature, and Date object with toDateString function to get the date
